# TextEverything
Our project for HackNotts 2017.

## The team
- **Toby Jones [(bitshiftsdotio)](http://github.com/bitshiftsdotio)**
- **Daniel Cordell [(DanielCordell)](http://github.com/DanielCordell)** 

## The idea
An app that receives texts and executes whatever code you like.

## The possibilities
- Turn on a lightbulb by sending a text.
- Get your bank balance.
- Write plugins to make it do more stuff.

We're working on a plugin repository, where users can upload plugins they've created and have other users of TextEverything download and review them.
