# TextEverything
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/texteverything/badge/?version=latest)](http://texteverything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Our project for HackNotts 2017.

## The team
- **Toby Jones [(monotron)](http://github.com/monotron)**
- **Daniel Cordell [(DanielCordell)](http://github.com/DanielCordell)** 

## The idea
An app that receives texts and executes whatever code you like.

## The possibilities
- Turn on a lightbulb by sending a text.
- Get your bank balance.
- Write plugins to make it do more stuff.

We're working on a plugin repository, where users can upload plugins they've created and have other users of TextEverything download and review them.

## The documentation
